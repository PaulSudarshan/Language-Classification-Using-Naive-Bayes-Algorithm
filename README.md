# Language-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
The project on Language Classification using Naive-Bayes algorithm deals with classifying as well as identifying the language of input string into its correct category. In order to demonstrate the use-case i have trained the model to detect three different languages with an adequate accuracy. The languages that i have chosen for this model are Slovak (sk), Czec (cs) and English (en). The purpose for choosing slovak and czec is that both of these languages are very similar in the way they are spoken, so if the model is able to distinguish between these two given languages that will ensure the robustness of our model to classify between other languages with a very good accuracy.
